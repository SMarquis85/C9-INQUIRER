## About

  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app. For example, what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

  ### Visuals

The following recording demonstrates the functionality:

> **(The visuals weren't functioning properly. File was too big. I tried doing a GIF - it was ridiculous. Whenever the NPM is downloaded I run into issues with NODE and INQUIRER. Package.json and Package-lock.json files don't seem accurate either.)**

## Final Work Review

**"Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."**  This action was applied to ALL JAVASCRIPT files. To create this README file, I used Sebastian Springer's Node.js book, references we're found on Google, GitHub, W3Schools, DEV and Tutorialspoint. YouTube was helpful and all ZOOM recordings (of previous classes). Looks much cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. Comments were added in JAVASCRIPT to show what was done and for what purpose. I've also created different files to write the code as JAVASCRIPT is a bit confusing for me but I seem to do better when I separate everything. Future development of this assignment, I would definetely fix the many issues I'm having by installing NPM, Node.js and Inquirer. The code needs work, still having problems
